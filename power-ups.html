            <h2>The Power-Ups?!</h2>
            <p>OUR FRIENDS USE POWER-UPS?!<br>They sure do, although since their lives were mixed in with a video game, power-ups from multiple games randomly started showing up so now they use them.</br></p>
            <p>Some of the power ups include, Mario's Coins, Sonic's Rings, Kirby's Metamato, Minecraft's Creative Menu, Mario Maker's Maker Panel and much more.</p>
            <p>Our good freind Storemanager, takes care of the items and makes sure that Ponja and his friends can use them whenever they need to. Hence the name Storemanager.</p>
