            <img width="50px" src="img/Ponja Thinking.png" alt="What Can The Story Line Be?">
            <p>I bet you are wondering what the basic story line will be for our show when it releases. Well here is a small description we have.</p>
            <p>Here we have the basic storyline. Our story begins with our three friends Ponja, Ginger and C.C (for more information on them visit our characters tab). Everyday they have adventures and activities to keep them busy throughout the day. Sometimes their adventures take place during the night and will proably be on of the more dangerous adventures since their night adventures are more difficult for them since they have no rest or sunlight to progress.</br></p>
            <p>Every now and then, Ponja and his friends find themselves in tricky situations, such as battling on of the element kings. But nothing is impossible when they combine their stregths to defeat their enemies. Their adventures almost always begin at Ponja's house, and then from their they decide where they will go. They have plenty of places to go such as the Big's and Mini Big's Desert, The No-Burger's Diner, King Big's Fortress, The Forest of Thorns, Ginger's House, C.C's Man Cave and so many other places.</p>
            <p>Everyday they sent off for a new place and will not stop until they reach their destinations, even if there are enemies just running around in the plains as well. Thankfully with the power-ups they keep (For more info visit the Power-Ups? page) and their creature companions, it makes it a breeze to pass the plains.</p>
